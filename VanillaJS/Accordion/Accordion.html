<!-- Design and implement Accordion
 
Requirements:
1 - Create an accordion that includes at least three sections (expandable/ collapsible) 
2 - Ensure that expanded section is visually distinct from inactive sections


Bonus:
1 - Implement a default system that is expanded on the initial load of the page
2 - Consider scalability, and how you can add more content sections dynamically.
